# Abstract Factories
`abstract_factories` provides functional factory classes extending the 
conventional Abstract Factory design pattern.
The primary use case is to provide a clear layer of abstraction 
for scalable data.

Abstract factories is influenced by https://github.com/mikemalinowski/factories.
